# APP NAME

## Tracks

- Base (Build Innovative Consumer Apps on Base)
- Coinbase Developer Platform (Consumer Crypto Prize, CDP SDK, and OnchainKit Pool Prize)
- [x] Akave (Store your hackathon project data using Akave)

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

Finding the right ML model for your need is very tough and finding the right dataset for training and building the model is evven tougher. On APP NAME users can come along and share their ML Models and Datasets for other to buy and contribute.

## ðŸ’» What it does

tldr;
- Allow user to deploy their ML models and datasets.
- Other users can come along to contribute to it.
- People can also buy your ML models.
- The buy price will be given to the person who deployed it and the contributors.
- Users can bet against different ML Model to find which one is the best among all and encourage other devs to build and deploy more model on the platform.
- Request for custom dataset can be confirmed by some sort of ai agents <still figuring this out>

## ðŸŽ¯ Ideal User

- New user in the ecosystem.
- AI/ML Model developer and researchers.

## Challenges I ran into

- Completing the project under given time frame.
- Building on new tech like Akave was bit tough but team helped us to tackel our problem.
