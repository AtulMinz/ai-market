- [x] Akave (Store your hackathon project data using Akave)

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

Finding the right machine learning model for your needs can be challenging, and sourcing the appropriate datasets for training and building those models is even tougher. ChainModels provides a collaborative platform where users can share their machine learning models and datasets, making it easier for others to discover, purchase, and contribute to innovative solutions. Join us in fostering a community that empowers developers and researchers to leverage shared resources for greater impact in the AI/ML landscape.

## ðŸ’» What it does

ChainModels enables users to:
- Put their machine learning models and datasets seamlessly.
- Collaborate with others by allowing contributions to existing models.
- Monetize their models, with earnings shared between the original deployer and contributors.
- Engage in model comparisons by betting on different ML models to identify the best performers, encouraging further development and deployment.
<!-- - Request custom datasets, facilitated by AI agents (details are still being finalized). -->
